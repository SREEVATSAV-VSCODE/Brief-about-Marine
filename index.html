          <h3>The scientific study of classifying organisms is called taxonomy. The classification system is based on shared characteristics and is used to understand the evolutionary history and relationships between organisms.</br></h3>

          <h3>The main ranks in the modern classification system are: </br></h3><ul>
          <h3><li>Domain: The three domains are Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya </br></li></h3>
          <h3><li>Kingdom: The five kingdoms are Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, and Monera</br></li></h3> 
          <h3><li>Phylum: For example, Chordata is the phylum that includes humans </br></li></h3> 
          <h3><li>Class: For example, Mammalia is the class that includes humans </br></li></h3>
          <h3><li>Order: For example, Primates is the order that includes humans </br></li></h3> 
          <h3><li>Family: For example, Hominidae is the family that includes humans </br></li></h3>

          <h3>The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus is considered the founder of the modern classification system. He developed the Linnaean system of taxonomy and binomial nomenclature for naming organisms.</h3>

          <h3>Animals can also be divided according to their habitat as per aristotle.</h3>

          <h3>Aristotle, a Greek scientist, was one of the first to classify living things. His classification system divided organisms into two main groups: plants and animals.</h3>
        </section>
        
        <section>
         <h3> He further classified these groups based on various characteristics, including:</h3>
          <ul>
          <li><h3>Habitat</br>
          Aristotle divided organisms into three groups based on where they lived: terrestrial (land), aquatic (water), and aerial (air).</br> </h3></li>
 
          <li><h3>Morphology</br>
          Aristotle classified plants into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on their morphological features, such as height and girth. </br></h3></li>
 
          <li><h3>Presence of RBCs</br>
          Aristotle classified animals into two groups based on whether they had red blood cells (RBCs): enaima (with RBCs) and anaima (without RBCs). </br></h3></li>
 
          <li><h3>Soft-shelled or hard-shelled</br>
          Aristotle divided animals without blood into soft-shelled Malakostraka (crabs, lobsters, and shrimps), and hard-shelled Ostrakoderma (gastropods and bivalves).</li>
          <li>He also divided soft-bodied animals into Malakia (cephalopods) and divisible animals into Entoma (insects, spiders, scorpions, ticks). </br></h3></li> 
        </ul>
